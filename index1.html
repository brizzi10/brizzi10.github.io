      <p>I began as a computer engineering student at Virginia Tech. Despite a great situation, I found the classes very unfulfilling and constantly felt as if I lacked the pasion to pursue the career these studies would eventually manifest. After my sophmore year, an opportunity presented itself to coach a youth basketball team. Fueled by my lifetime passion for the sport, I dove completely into the environment. After the season, I decided to take a break from school to pursue a business training local players.</p>
      <p>The success of this venture atracted the attention of a nearby sports comlex, and I was brought in as the Assistant Director of Mens AAU Basketball, and later was promoted to the Head of the Basketball Academy.</p>
      <p>Throughout this rewarding period of working with the youth and coaching a sport that I love, never once did I lose my interest in coding. It was the one aspect of my time at Virginia Tech that I enjoyed, and while employed as a coach I also enrolled in Java Classes on the side, and simultaneously began a more cursory study of Web Development.</p>
      <p>As my basketball business venture began to reach a plateau, I decided it was time to dive fully into web development, which lead me to General Assembly.</p>
